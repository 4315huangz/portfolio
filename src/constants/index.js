export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate full-stack developer with a Master’s degree in Computer and Information Science, specializing in building robust, scalable web applications. With expertise in front-end technologies like React and back-end technologies such as Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, I am dedicated to creating innovative, user-focused solutions that drive business growth and enhance user experience. My goal is to continually refine my skills and contribute to projects that make a real impact.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `After years of working as an CPA, I began to notice a pattern in my daily tasks: many of them were repetitive, manual, and often outsourced to contractors. It struck me that these processes could be streamlined and automated, reducing errors and freeing up time for more strategic work. This realization sparked a passion for technology and led me to pursue a Master 
of Science in Computer and Information Science at Marquette University. For two years, I immersed myself in the world of software development, learning how to harness the power of code to solve complex problems and create efficient solutions. Now, with a strong foundation in both accounting and software development, I'm excited to embark on a new journey as a software developer, where I can 
combine my unique background to innovate and drive meaningful change.`;
